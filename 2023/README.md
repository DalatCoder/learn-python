[Udemy](https://udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp)

## Introduction

### Why Python?

Brief History of Python

- Created in 1990 by Guido van Rossum
- Python 3 released in 2008
- Specifically designed as an easy to
  use language
- High focus on readability of code

Why choose Python?

- Designed for clear, logical code that is
  easy to read and learn
- Lots of existing libraries and frameworks
  written in Python allowing users to
  apply Python to a wide variety of tasks
- Focuses on optimizing developer time,
  rather than a computer's processing time
- [Docs](docs.python.org/3)

What can you do with Python?

- This course first focuses on "base" Python,
  which consists of the core components of
  the language and writing scripts and small
  programs.
- Later we begin to learn about outside
  libraries and frameworks that greatly expand
  Python's capabilities
- Automate simple tasks
  - Searching for files and editing them
  - Scraping information from a website
  - Reading and editing excel files
  - Work with PDFs
  - Automate emails and text messages
  - Fill out forms

Data science and machine learning

- Analyze large data files
- Create visualizations
- Perform machine learning tasks
- Create and run predictive algorithms

Create websites

- Use web frameworks such as Django and Flask
  to handle the backend of a website and user
  data
- Create interactive dashboards for users

## Python Setup

### Installing Python

- There are many ways to run Python!
- Later on we'll explore the difference
  between running a Python `.py` script
  or running Python code in a notebook
  environment

Install with Anaconda

- To install Python we will use the free
  Individual Anaconda distribution
- This distribution includes Python as well
  as many other useful libraries, including
  Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Anaconda can also easily be installed on
  to any major OS, Windows, MacOS or Linux

### Running Python code

There are several ways to run Python code.

First, let's discuss the various options
for development environments

- Text editors
- Full IDEs
- Notebook Environments

Text editors:

- General editors for any text file
- Work with a variety of file types
- Can be customized with plugins and add-ons
- Keep in mind, most are not designed
  with only Python in mind

Full IDEs

- Development Environments designed speccifically for Python
- Larger programs
- Only community editions are free
- Designed specifically for Python, lots
  of extra functionality

Notebook Environments

- Great for learning
- See input and output next to each other
- Support in-line markdown notes,
  visualizations, videos, and more
- Special file formats that are not `.py`
