- Automate simple tasks
  - Searching for files and editing them
  - Scraping information from a website
  - Reading and editing excel files
  - Work with PDFs
  - Automate emails and text messages
  - Fill out forms

Data science and machine learning

- Analyze large data files
- Create visualizations
- Perform machine learning tasks
- Create and run predictive algorithms

Create websites

  to handle the backend of a website and user
  data
